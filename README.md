# Real-time Job Postings System

This is a simple system created to demonstrate how messaging, data processing and data streaming work in reactive sytems. It has four main parts
* Data publisher - is a scheduled program that runs in a specific time interval and generates random job postings data to a kafka topic
* Data processor service - is a Kafka streaming service that does filtering on the data generated by data publisher and sends it back to a separate Kafka topic
* Data consumer service - is a subscriber that listens to incoming messages in Kafka topics, saves the messages to reactive mongo database. It also uses server sent events to send them as streams for external clients 
* Single page angular application - makes http calls to the consumer service to get real-time data

## Technologies used

* SpringBoot
* Spring Webflux
* Reactive mongo db
* Spring kafka
* Spring kafka streams
* Angular
